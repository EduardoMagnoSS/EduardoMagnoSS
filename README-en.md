I am very interested on the software development world, mainly on programming. I intend to become a full stack web developer, but with focus on backend.

Currently, I am on my self-learning jorney to become a junior dev. I am studying the frontend basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript) at the moment.

I am working on a personal project where I create a site that was inicially made on canvas for a school work to solidify my knowledge on the three basic languages of frontend development.
